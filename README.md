  Purposed to each teacher because it's subjects treat about the components of is composed this project.
  
  Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira
  
  This project is only for academic purposes to show the teachers the abilities over the components of is composed this project.

  The project is going to get bigger since it was proposed because I'm a student of the previously mentioned subject, and I develop websites empirically.
  
  But I think that I'm doing that in a good way...
  
  I'm developing the project to the best of my ability. To present it as request to validation to pass the subject.

  I'm not interested on repeating classes about things that I already know.
  
  
  Pattern used: MVC (Model-View-Controller) but in this project the folders have a pattern like:
  
    Model = Procedures
    
    View = Views
    
    Controller = Controllers 
    
  
  Technologies used:
  
    FrontEnd: HTML + CSS + JS + jQuery + BOOTSTRAP
    
    BackEnd: PHP + mySQL
    
    Extras: Using jQueryUI for Dialogs and AlertifyJS for alert dialogs.
    
  
  Explaining the directory composition:
  -
    Folder 'components': Has icons, pictures and scripts made strictly by me for the website.
    
    Folder 'controllers': Has the files called by a user's request in the website, as interventor between procedures and views, has the majority of view parameters to send to view drivers.
    
    Folder 'css': Has the files that apply styles on the website and include the files used by many frameworks and plugins.
    
    Folder 'plugins': Has the JS Core files used by many JS Frameworks that aren't made by me but I need to use them.
    
    Folder 'procedures': Has the files that the controller use to pull and push data on the DB or advanced procedures that the controller can't host.
    
    Folder 'views': Has the files that manage the user interface and graphical answer in the website. 
      ! - Some views have methods to modify a little things in the UI depending on the controller's answer and instructions to the views. But this corresponds only to view logic and not business logic. 
    
    File 'Desktop': Acts like a Dashboard, is the page that the user see after a correct login procedure.
    
    File 'index': Is the first page that the user see. Nobody can pass this page without a login.
    
    File 'profile': Is the page made to see a user's profile and it's content. It isn't necessary to be logged in to use this page.
    
    File 'viewPost': Is the page made to see an specific post/entry. It isn't necessary to be logged in to use this page.
    
    File 'FirstAccess': Is the page made to first user's loggin, contains a procedure to verify if the user's email is the same as the signup email.

    File 'RecoveryAccount': Is the page to start account and access procedure.

    File 'RecoveryAccess': Is the page to finish account and access procedure.
